                    Iâ€™m a software developer, I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as I continue to learn new languages and development techniques that are important to me and the success of the organization. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Through my Experience, I have developed a strong understanding of JavaScript (ES5 & ES6), React, Node.js, Express, Java, Php, just to name few. As a developer, I find a lot of joy and excitement utilizing my skills to help troubleshoot bugs and pushing projects forward. I enjoy learning new technologies and growing in a field that is constantly being pushed to new boundaries.</p>
